# Life Simulator

A Python program that simulates a simple ecosystem.
The red squares represent male carnivore types, yellow squares represent female carnivore types, blue squares represent male herbivores, and green squares represent female herbivores.
Female types are 25% more likely to be produced after the original four organisms.
The speed and lifespan of an organism is based on the speed and lifespan of it's parents. They are random numbers generated from a range of which the parent's speed or lifespan is the median.
